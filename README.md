Project title: Leveraging Machine Learning Models to Generate Product Descriptions in e-Commerce

Abstract: This project addressed the challenge of incomplete or inadequate product descriptions in e-Commerce by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-to-text technology. Collaborating with a national retailer, we proposed a new solution to improve the online shopping experience. Our methodology involved evaluating and enhancing product descriptions across various scenarios by utilizing computer vision and LLMs to iteratively generate and refine content, covering 111 thousand unique products. Additionally, we introduced a new scoring model to assess description quality, considering relevance, completeness, readability, and confidence score. As a result, our solution can improve 73% of products with unqualified descriptions or with only images. Our study offered a strategy for retailers to optimize product listings, ultimately enhancing competitiveness and customer engagement in e-Commerce.
